## Willie Breaux - Applied AI / Computer Vision Portfolio
This repository contains all of my completed work for **ITAI 1378 - Computer Vision** at Houston City College.  
It includes my assignments, labs, midterm project, and final project completed during Fall 2025.

The portfolio demonstrates my progression through the course, covering:
- Image processing fundamentals  
- Classical machine learning for computer vision  
- Convolutional neural networks  
- Transfer learning and object detection  
- Vision-language models  
- Emotion recognition

# Labs Completed
Below is a summary of the labs I completed in this course.

### Lab 01 - Loading & Viewing Images
Used Python and OpenCV/Matplotlib to load, display, and analyze basic image properties.

### Lab 02 - Image Processing Fundamentals
Performed point operations, neighborhood operations, filtering, and histogram analysis.

### Lab 03 - Classical ML for Image Classification
Trained classical ML models (SVM, kNN) on small image datasets; compared performance.

### Lab 05 - CNN: Chihuahua or Muffin
Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.

### Lab 06 - Object Detection with Transfer Learning
Used Faster R-CNN / VOC dataset for object detection. Explored performance metrics.

### Lab 08 - Vision-Language Models
Experimented with BLIP / VLMs to generate image captions and interpret multimodal outputs.
